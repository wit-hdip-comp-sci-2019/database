SQL is used to communicate with a database. \n\n## Table Basics\n\nA relational database system contains one or more objects called *tables*. The data or information for the database are stored in these tables. \nTables are uniquely identified by their *name* and are comprised of *columns* and *rows*. Columns contain the column name, data type, and any other attributes \nfor the column. Rows contain the records or data for the columns. Here is a sample table called \"weather\".\nThe values city, state, high, and low are the columns. The rows contain the data for this table:\n\n![](img/table.png)"

The schema is stored in **supplierproducts.sql**.\n\n- Open *MySQL Workbench* and log in using password root. \n\nTo run the script:\n\n- Under the *File* menu, choose *Run SQL Script …*. \n- When the dialog box opens, select *supplierproducts.sql*. \n- Click the button *Open* and on the next dialog box, click *Run*.  \n- When the Operation has run successfully, click Close.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n- Choose *Open SQL Script …*. \n- When the dialog box opens, select *supplierproducts.sql*. \n- Click the button *Open*.

For example, to return the columns (fname and lname) from the supplier\ntable, enter (and execute) the following command:\n\n~~~\n select fname, lname from supplier;\n~~~\n\nTo select a subset of rows (records), you need to include a `WHERE` clause with some condition(s). For example, to return all suppliers form Dublin. The\ncondition would be location = 'Dublin'. Enter (and execute) the following command:\n\n~~~\n select * from supplier where location = 'dublin';\n~~~\n\n## To do\n\n1. Return all rows and columns from the product table.\n2. Return the name and description of all products.\n3. Return all product details for the product identified by productCode 'p13111';\n4. Return the fname and lname for all suppliers from London.\n5.

AND` is the better option.\n\n## To do\n \n 1. Return all product details for products that cost 50 euro or less.\n 2.

This\njoins tables where there is a match between the primary key value of one table and the foreign key value of the other.\n\nIn the following example we join the tables together and return all columns. Enter (and execute) the following command:\n\n~~~\n select * from supplier natural join product;\n~~~\n\nThe above statement will work if the primary key and foreign key values have the same name. If they do not, you could use the following:\n\n~~~\n select * from supplier join product on supplier.supplierId = product.supplierId;\n~~~\n\nThis will return all columns and the `common` column is duplicated.\n\nAnother example that returns the product name and the supplier name that supplies the product, enter (and execute) the following command:\n\n~~~\n select name, fname, lname from supplier natural join product;\n~~~\n\n## To do\n\nReturn the name and description of all products supplied by all suppliers from London."
