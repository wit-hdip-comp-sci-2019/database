SQL is used to communicate with a database. \r\n\r\n## Table Basics\r\n\r\nA relational database system contains one or more objects called *tables*. The data or information for the database are stored in these tables. \r\nTables are uniquely identified by their *name* and are comprised of *columns* and *rows*. Columns contain the column name, data type, and any other attributes \r\nfor the column. Rows contain the records or data for the columns. Here is a sample table called \"weather\".\r\nThe values city, state, high, and low are the columns. The rows contain the data for this table:\r\n\r\n![](img/table.png)"

The schema is stored in **supplierproducts.sql**.\r\n\r\n- Open *MySQL Workbench* and log in using password root. \r\n\r\nTo run the script:\r\n\r\n- Under the *File* menu, choose *Run SQL Script …*. \r\n- When the dialog box opens, select *supplierproducts.sql*. \r\n- Click the button *Open* and on the next dialog box, click *Run*.  \r\n- When the Operation has run successfully, click Close.\r\n\r\nAlternatively:\r\n\r\n- Choose *Open SQL Script …*. \r\n- When the dialog box opens, select *supplierproducts.sql*. \r\n- Click the button *Open*.
